# 🔍 Glass Identification - Classification Task  
### 🧠 AI Second Practical (Using Orange Tool & Python)

---

## 📌 Description  
This project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques using the **Orange Tool** and **Python** to solve a classification problem on the *Glass Identification Dataset*. The goal is to develop skills in data preprocessing, unsupervised learning (clustering), and supervised learning (classification).

---

## 🧩 Project Structure  
This project consists of **3 main parts**:

### 1️⃣ **Data Preprocessing & Exploration**  
**Goal:**  
To familiarize the student team with the dataset by exploring its structure, understanding the attributes, handling missing values (if any), and selecting features that will be used in the classification task.  
Tools used: Orange Tool & Python (pandas, seaborn, etc.)

### 2️⃣ **Clustering Analysis**  
**Goal:**  
To investigate the internal structure of the dataset using clustering algorithms such as K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering. This part aims to check whether the earlier observations about class separability are reflected in the unsupervised learning outcomes.  

### 3️⃣ **Classification Algorithms**  
**Goal:**  
To apply **at least 3 classification algorithms** such as Artifical neural networks, K-nearest neighbour, Random Forest to the selected features and analyze their performance. Evaluation metrics include accuracy, confusion matrix, and cross-validation scores.
